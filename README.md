# System Profiler #
**System Profiler** is a project that is setup to provide information on the user's system and browser via client-side script/access.

---

## Scope ##
The *System Profiler* can be used for troubleshooting purposes when a user is experiencing issues when browsing within an online resource/tool.

## How to Use ##
You can send the URL of the *System Profiler* to the user. When they click on the link, the *HTML* page will generate the user's data. At the top of the page a button is provided labeled as *Send Data*. Once the user clicks on this, using the user's email client a new email is created with the user's data in the body of the email. All they need to do is click send.

### Adding Your Email Address ###
You can add your email address to the end of the URL and when the user clicks the *Send Data* button, your email address will populate in the *To* field.

*For Example:*
    
    www.yourdomain.com/folderForSystemProfiler/?x=youremailaddress@yourdomain.com
